In conclusion, 29CM's customer base is primarily composed of women in their 20s to 40s who prefer shopping on Tuesdays and Sundays. To attract both men and women, promotional events should be scheduled on these days. Additionally, to take advantage of the popularity of t-shirts and blouses during warmer months, a promotional campaign should be launched from late June to early July.

To strengthen 29CM's market position, it is recommended to collaborate with popular brands such as LENINA and MARDI MECREDI. By offering exclusive launches and promotions for their products on 29CM, the company can attract more customers and boost sales. Overall, implementing these strategies will help 29CM increase its market share and drive growth in the highly competitive online retail industry.
